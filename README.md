# Semantic Movie Search Engine

A machine learning-powered search system that finds movies by understanding the semantic meaning of plot descriptions rather than relying on exact keyword matches.

## What This Project Does

This implementation creates an intelligent movie recommendation system that uses advanced natural language processing to match user queries with relevant films. Instead of simple text matching, it understands context and meaning to deliver more accurate results.

### Core Technologies

* **SentenceTransformers** with `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model for generating semantic embeddings
* **Cosine similarity** algorithms for measuring content relatedness
* **Pandas** for efficient data processing and result presentation

The system excels at finding thematically similar movies even when search terms don't directly appear in plot summaries.

## Key Capabilities

* Context-aware semantic matching that goes beyond keyword searches
* Configurable result count with relevance scoring
* Robust testing suite ensuring reliability
* Well-structured codebase with comprehensive documentation

## System Requirements

* Python 3.9+
* Git version control
* Jupyter Notebook environment

## Installation Guide

### 1. Repository Setup
```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd movie-search-assignment
```

### 2. Environment Configuration
**Windows Users:**
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

**macOS/Linux Users:**
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Dependency Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Launch Application
```bash
jupyter notebook movie_search_solution.ipynb
```

## Quality Assurance

Execute the test suite to verify system functionality:

```bash
python -m unittest tests/test_movie_search.py -v
```

The tests validate:
* Output structure correctness (DataFrame format with required columns)
* Parameter handling (`top_n` functionality)
* Score validity (similarity values between 0 and 1)
* Result relevance accuracy

## Implementation Examples

### Interactive Notebook Usage
Launch `movie_search_solution.ipynb` to explore the complete implementation with step-by-step explanations.

### Programmatic Usage
```python
from movie_search import search_movies

# Find movies matching a thematic query
results = search_movies('romantic comedy set in New York', top_n=5)
print(results)
```

### Sample Results
```
                    title                                               plot  similarity
0      Love in Manhattan  Two strangers meet in a New York coffee shop...    0.892341
1    Big City Romance    A writer discovers love while exploring NYC...     0.756892
2      Urban Hearts      Comedy about dating mishaps in Manhattan...        0.698234
3    Metropolitan Love  Romantic entanglements among young profession...    0.634567
4      City of Dreams   A couple navigates relationship challenges...       0.578912
```

## Technical Implementation

### Processing Pipeline
1. **Vectorization**: Text content is transformed into high-dimensional embeddings using pre-trained language models
2. **Similarity Analysis**: Mathematical comparison of vector representations using cosine similarity metrics  
3. **Result Ranking**: Movies are ordered by relevance scores and filtered to requested quantity

### Model Selection
The `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model provides an optimal balance of accuracy and computational efficiency for this application domain.
